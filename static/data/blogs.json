I know building website with Expo is not the best option, I just experimenting back then. I really want to try tailwindcss from a long time, because the hype of this css framework is big its making me curios of this framework.</p>\n<p>Recently I was not busy so I decided to try tailwindcss, and it was magical. Last time I use a css framework is many years ago (I was using Bootstrap at that time). I didn't know any utilty first css framework until I try tailwind.</p>\n<p>I use DatoCMS for the CMS of my site, combining it with Next.js is just smooth, I love seeing my lighthouse score now haha.</p>\n<p>Last year I attended a virtual talk with Surabaya.JS, Griko Nibras was talking about dynamic social image for website, I was having trouble about this topic. I was lucky enough to attend this because I really want to know how to do this, and now I implementing it on my site.

There are 2 cases given:</p>\n<p>1.Enjoy online concerts during a pandemic\n2. IT Security We take the first case.</p>\n<p>I teamed up with Ocky. My communication is not very good luckily Ocky is a Communication students so I decided to bring him to the team to help me with presentation and brainstorming, btw we lived in the same house.</p>\n<p>We have an idea, what if online ticket concert can be bought seperately(ketengan) so the audience can watch it seperately with a different rundown in one festival/online concert, because in online concert case this is possible.</p>\n<p>So we decided to take that idea to development and going through some mentoring session until the product was done. Then on 17 Oct the winner announced, we got 2nd place!</p>\n<p>Full read and some development process (in Indonesian) on my twitter</p>\n<p>Source code : <a href=\"https://https://github.com/codingki/TikTeng\">https://github.com/codingki/TikTeng</a></p>\n",
